# BioContainers Registry UI


This project provides a web UI for [BioContainers](https://biocontainers.pro)

* This application is written in JavaScript, and you can deploy this application easily.
* This application doesn't store any user data.
* You can find the necessary information simply from the Docker Registry [documentation](http://biocontainers.pro/docs/101/biocontainers-registry/).


#### How to Test

- To test the application go to **dist** directory and install `npm install -g http-server`, then use `httop-server` to test the app:
