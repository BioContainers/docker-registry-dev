This is the home page...
We click on it and we go to All Namespaces page.

Here we fetch the data from IP/v1/search and make a list of all the namespaces.
And each namespace is a link.
This link is generated using ng-repeat in the showNamespaces.html
I click on it and I go to All Repositories page with a get parameter of namespace

Now here I do the same thing to generate the further link to the images page.
But here I encounter an error...

I tried searching...but no help

Could not find a similar error.
One place it was written that "file:///" is not allowed much times during routing...
We then tried in a server...and used "http://" then the URL was changed...
but no refresh of the page was there.

Here page does not change
But on refresh it does.

That link is home link and it is clickable since it is not in ng-repeat....but in below links..this error is there.
